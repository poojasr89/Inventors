The assumption is that patented inventions indicate an orientation towards research, although the underlying motivation is corporate profits.


1. Look at inventors_16.py : Although population of CA is higher, percentage of patent grantees in MA is higher than that in CA.

2. Let us look at how population of just CA and MA have evolved over time v/s percentage patent grantees from these two states: inventors_v20.py

3. Another interesting data to look at is the categories in which these patents were awarded in CA and MA: inventors_v11.py
As we had noticed earlier, the total number of patent grantees (as % of population) is higher in MA. Inventions percentage in computers and electronic industries are very identical in the two states where as there is drastic difference in chemical and medical (drugs based) inventions. 

4. Since we are interested in women inventors, let us only focus on female population in CA and MA over time v/s female patent grantees from these two states: inventors_v21.py
  - It is interesting to see the comparison of Male and Female population in CA and MA v/s Male and Female patent grantees

5. Now, let us look at how many women under 30 years of age have become patent grantees in CA and MA : inventors_v24.py

Inference: Although there is an overall decline in the number of young women inventors, the data shows that Massachusetts is more conducive to women inventors in the fields of chemical and medical research than other states.
